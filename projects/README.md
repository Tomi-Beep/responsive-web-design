# Certification Projects – Responsive Web Design

This folder contains the **five required projects** I completed for the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/your-username/responsive-web-design-certificate).

Each project meets the user story and technical requirements outlined by freeCodeCamp and was built using only HTML and CSS. These projects demonstrate my ability to create responsive, accessible, and well-structured webpages.

You can view each project live below:

## About the Course

These projects were created as part of the **Responsive Web Design** course by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The curriculum focuses on building strong HTML and CSS fundamentals through practical projects, culminating in a certification upon successful completion.

To earn the certificate, each project had to meet strict accessibility, responsiveness, and semantic structure guidelines — all without using JavaScript.
