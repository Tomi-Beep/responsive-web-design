# Responsive Web Design

This repository documents my journey through the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** certification. It’s organized into two main folders:

- **`practice/`**  
  Contains the source files for 15 guided mini-projects covering core HTML & CSS concepts **plus** a `README.md` with live‑demo links.

- **`projects/`**  
  Contains the five official capstone projects for the certification, including my personal portfolio page (coming soon):
  1. **Survey Form**

## About the Certification

I completed the freeCodeCamp **Responsive Web Design** certification, which you can view here:  
`https://www.freecodecamp.org/your-username/responsive-web-design-certificate`  

This curriculum guides you through:

- **15 practice projects** to learn individual skills  
- **5 capstone projects** to demonstrate mastery  

Completion of the capstones earns the Responsive Web Design certification. This repo serves as my portfolio for everything I built along the way.
