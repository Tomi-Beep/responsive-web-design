# Responsive Web Design

This repository documents my journey through the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** certification. It’s organized into two main folders:

- **`practice/`**  
  Contains the source files for 15 guided mini-projects covering core HTML & CSS concepts **plus** a `README.md` with live‑demo links.

- **`projects/`**  
  Contains the five official capstone projects for the certification, including my personal portfolio page (coming soon):
  1. **Survey Form**  
     https://tomi-beep.github.io/responsive-web-design/projects/survey-form  
  2. **Tribute Page**  
     https://tomi-beep.github.io/responsive-web-design/projects/tribute-page  
  3. **Technical Documentation Page**  
     https://tomi-beep.github.io/responsive-web-design/projects/technical-documentation-page
  4. **Product Landing Page**  
     https://tomi-beep.github.io/responsive-web-design/projects/product-landing-page  
  6. **Portfolio Page** (in development)  
     https://tomi-beep.github.io/responsive-web-design/projects/portfolio-page
