## Rothko Painting â€“ Exploring the CSS Box Model

In this project, I created a Rothko-style painting using HTML and CSS to explore how the Box Model works. I used elements like `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `width/height` to control the spacing and layout of rectangular shapes on the page.

This exercise helped me develop a deeper understanding of how every HTML element behaves as a box and how to use CSS properties to manipulate their appearance and positioning effectively.
