## Accessibility Quiz â€“ Building for Inclusive Web Use

In this project, I created a quiz webpage with a focus on accessibility. The goal was to ensure that the interface is usable for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Throughout the process, I implemented ARIA attributes, added meaningful keyboard navigation, and followed accessibility best practices to make sure the content is perceivable, operable, and understandable by assistive technologies. This exercise helped me better understand the importance of inclusive design and how to apply accessibility principles in real-world projects.
