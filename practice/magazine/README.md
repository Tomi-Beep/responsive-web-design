## Magazine â€“ Layout Design with CSS Grid

In this project, I created a magazine-style article layout using HTML and CSS Grid. I structured the page using rows and columns, practicing how to define grid tracks, place elements precisely within the grid, and manage spacing and alignment.

This exercise gave me a solid understanding of how CSS Grid can be used to build responsive, organized layouts with complex structure while keeping the code clean and readable.
