## Cat Photo App â€“ Learning HTML Structure

In this project, I built a simple cat photo app to practice using fundamental HTML tags. I structured the page using elements like images, buttons, headings, paragraphs, and lists, gaining a solid understanding of how HTML defines the content and layout of a webpage.

This exercise was a great introduction to the core building blocks of web development and helped me get comfortable with writing clean, semantic HTML.
