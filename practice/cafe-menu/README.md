## Cafe Menu â€“ Styling a Webpage with CSS

In this project, I designed a cafe menu page to practice the fundamentals of CSS styling. I used CSS to control the layout, font styles, colors, and spacing of the page, creating a clean and readable menu design.

This exercise helped me understand how to apply consistent styling across elements, organize content visually, and create a cohesive look and feel using only CSS. It was a great way to solidify the basics of web design presentation.
