## Colored Markers â€“ Working with CSS Color Values

In this project, I created a set of colored markers using HTML and CSS, focusing on how to effectively apply and combine different color values. I experimented with various color formats like named colors, HEX codes, RGB, and HSL to understand how each can be used to style elements.

This exercise also helped me explore color pairing and contrast, which are essential for creating visually appealing and accessible designs.
