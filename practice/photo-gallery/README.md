## Photo Gallery â€“ Building Responsive Layouts with Flexbox

In this project, I created a responsive photo gallery using HTML and CSS Flexbox. I used Flexbox properties to align and distribute the images across different screen sizes, ensuring the layout adapts smoothly whether viewed on a desktop or mobile device.

This exercise gave me practical experience with Flexbox concepts like `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`, and responsive design strategies for modern web development.
