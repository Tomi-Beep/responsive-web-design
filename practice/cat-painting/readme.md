## Cat Painting â€“ CSS Positioning and Layering

In this project, I built a cat painting using HTML and CSS to practice advanced positioning techniques. The focus was on mastering absolute positioning, using the `z-index` property to layer elements correctly, and applying `transform` to fine-tune placement.

This exercise gave me hands-on experience with controlling element layout in a precise way, which is especially useful for creating complex, responsive web designs and custom graphics without relying on external images.
