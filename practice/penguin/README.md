## Penguin â€“ CSS Transforms and Animation Practice

In this project, I practiced using CSS transforms to creatively manipulate HTML elements. I built a cartoon-style penguin entirely with HTML and CSS, applying various techniques such as `rotate()`, `scale()`, and `translate()` to properly position and resize each part of the character.

I also designed a matching background and added subtle animations to bring the penguin to life. This exercise helped me understand how CSS transforms can be used not just for layout adjustments, but also for adding engaging, dynamic visuals to a webpage.
