## What I Learned

- **CSS Transforms & Animation**: How to rotate, scale, and animate elements without JavaScript.  
- **Accessibility**: Implementing ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and best practices for inclusive design.  
- **Pseudo-Selectors**: Targeting elements based on state (`:hover`, `:nth-child()`, etc.) to enhance interactivity.  
- **Fundamental Styling**: Applying colors, typography, box model properties, and CSS variables for maintainable styles.  
- **Positioning & Layout**: Mastering absolute/relative positioning, z‑index layering, Flexbox, and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.  
- **Responsive Design**: Using media queries and flexible units to ensure designs look great on any device.  
- **Forms & HTML Structure**: Building semantic markup for forms and content, and controlling user input types with HTML attributes.

These projects solidified my understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create engaging, accessible, and responsive web pages. Feel free to explore each demo and view the source code in the respective folders.
