## City Skyline â€“ Using CSS Variables for Reusability

In this project, I built a city skyline scene using HTML and CSS, with a focus on learning how to use CSS variables. I defined custom properties for colors, sizes, and other reusable values to make the styling more maintainable and consistent.

This exercise helped me understand how CSS variables can simplify large-scale styling, improve code organization, and make future updates more efficient by centralizing key design values.
