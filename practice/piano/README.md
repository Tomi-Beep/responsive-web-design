## Piano â€“ Responsive Design and Interaction with CSS

In this project, I built a responsive piano interface using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a layout that adapts to various screen sizes while maintaining usability and visual clarity.

I used media queries to adjust styles based on screen width and applied pseudo-selectors to enhance interactivity. This project gave me a deeper understanding of responsive design techniques and how to use CSS to create interactive elements without JavaScript.
