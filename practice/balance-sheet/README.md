## Balance Sheet â€“ Styling with CSS Pseudo-Selectors

In this project, I built a simple balance sheet and focused on using CSS pseudo-selectors to enhance interactivity and visual hierarchy.

I used selectors like `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and others to style specific elements based on user interactions and element position. This allowed me to highlight important parts of the table and create a more engaging user experience. It also gave me hands-on practice with how CSS can react to user behavior without requiring JavaScript.
