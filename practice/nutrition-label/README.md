## Nutrition Label â€“ Practicing Web Typography

In this project, I built a nutrition label using HTML and CSS with a focus on typography. I styled the text to reflect the structure and clarity of a real-world nutrition label, adjusting font weights, sizes, line height, and spacing to ensure readability and precision.

This exercise helped me understand how to use CSS to control the visual presentation of text and reinforced the importance of typographic hierarchy in web design.
