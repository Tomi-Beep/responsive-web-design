## Ferris Wheel â€“ Animating Elements with CSS

In this project, I built a Ferris wheel using HTML and CSS to explore animation techniques. I used CSS animations and transforms to bring the structure to life, rotating the wheel and adding movement to the individual components.

This exercise helped me understand how to control animation timing, duration, and iteration to create smooth and visually engaging effects, all without relying on JavaScript.
