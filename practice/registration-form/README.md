## Registration Form â€“ Building and Styling HTML Forms

In this project, I created a registration form using HTML and CSS. I learned how to structure forms using various input types, apply labels for accessibility, and use attributes to control the type of data users can enter.

In addition to form structure, I also styled the page to improve the visual layout and user experience. This exercise helped me understand how forms function in a webpage and how to make them both user-friendly and visually appealing.
